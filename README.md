# JavaScript Monorepo Boilerplate

The app was built using React on the frontend and Express on the backend.

## 🧑‍💻 Local Development

Here's what you need to do to get this running on your local machine.

### Install

Make sure Node 16 is installed, then set up both client and server by running the following command in the root of the repository:

```
yarn
```

### Usage

Start the client and server and automatically open the page in your browser by running:

```
yarn start
```

### Tests

Run tests across both packages in parallel. A coverage report will be generated for the client after the tests run.

```
yarn test
```
